As an AI, I can't directly analyze the files as they are not provided. However, based on the user's prompt, I can suggest the following shared dependencies that might be present in a typical Node.js library:

1. **Node.js Core Modules**: These are built-in modules provided by Node.js, such as 'fs' for file system operations, 'http' for HTTP server and client functionality, 'path' for handling file and directory paths, etc.

2. **External Modules**: These are modules installed via npm (Node Package Manager), such as 'express' for web application framework, 'lodash' for utility functions, 'async' for asynchronous control flow, etc.

3. **Custom Modules**: These are user-defined modules that are created to separate the code into reusable parts. For example, 'utils.js' and 'errorHandler.js' in this case.

4. **Exported Variables and Functions**: These are variables and functions that are exported from one module and required in another. For example, utility functions from 'utils.js' might be used in 'index.js' and 'errorHandler.js'.

5. **Error Messages**: These are predefined error messages that are used in 'errorHandler.js' to handle different types of errors.

6. **Function Names**: These are names of functions that are used across different modules. For example, a function to handle errors might be defined in 'errorHandler.js' and used in 'index.js'.

7. **Data Schemas**: If the library is interacting with a database, there might be shared data schemas that define the structure of the data.

Please note that the actual shared dependencies can vary based on the specific functionality of the library.
