As an AI, I don't have access to the actual content of your "main.js" file. However, based on the standard practices, here are some potential shared dependencies that the "main.js" and "test/main.test.js" files might have:

1. Exported Variables: These are the variables that are exported from "main.js" and used in "test/main.test.js". They could be functions, objects, arrays, etc.

2. Data Schemas: If "main.js" is interacting with a database, the data schemas used in "main.js" would also be used in "test/main.test.js" to mock the database interactions.

3. DOM Element IDs: If "main.js" is manipulating DOM elements, the IDs of these elements would be used in "test/main.test.js" to simulate these manipulations.

4. Message Names: If "main.js" is emitting or listening to events, the names of these events would be used in "test/main.test.js" to simulate these events.

5. Function Names: The names of the functions defined in "main.js" would be used in "test/main.test.js" to test these functions.

Please replace these with the actual names from your "main.js" file.
